 1.14 16 Oct 2004 - Tuned module load time (about a 40% improvement) and
                    add performance tuning hints

 1.13 28 Sep 2004 - Removed support for Module::Build.
 
 1.12 25 Sep 2004 - Tweaked the default form parser to accept ';' as a field seperator
                    in addition to '&'. Change suggested by Peter Karman.
                    Eliminated the explicit application/sgml-form-urlencoded support
                    as redundant (it still works, it is just not explicitly different
                    than application/x-www-form-urlencoded support anymore).

                    Adjusted the multipart form parser to be more robust against
                    malformed MIME boundaries and the build tests to work around a
                    bug in Perl 5.8.0 UTF8ness and split.

                    Added documentation of command line script testing behavior.

                    Tightened up the code to reduce size (went from 14.9K to 11K).

                    Removed the 'sgml_safe_mode' redirect code since there
                    was no exposed interface to it anyway.

                    Squashed a bug where the global buffer might fail to initialize
                    correctly for 0 byte POST forms (only impacted  use of the 'raw'
                    method for POST use).

                    Added regression test for form truncation

                    Added LICENSE section to documentation

                    Added Module::Build installation support

 1.11 28 Sep 2003 - Tweaked test script to avoid warnings about
                    opening STDIN filehandle for writing. No functional
                    changes.

 1.10 04 Apr 2003 - Added 'binmode STDIN' on module load to correct for
                    windows defaulting to 7-bit filehandles. Fixed problem where
                    split would fail on unusual MIME boundary strings.
                    Problems noticed by Markus Wichitill.

                    Deferred loading of 'Carp' unless actually needed.

                    Small code cleanups.

                    Removed big disclaimer from .pm and moved
                    in pod to 'DISCLAIMERS' section

                    Added tests

 1.09 19 Mar 2002 - Exposed CGI::Minimal::reset_globals class method to support non-
                    mod_perl persistent execution environments.

 1.08 26 Jul 2001 - Added 'raw' method for obtaining a dump of the raw input buffer data
                    without any parsing. Seperated POD docs into a distinct .pod file.

 1.07 01 Dec 2000 - Added capability of taking a GET style parameter string
                    via STDIN if running at the command line.

 1.06 10 Apr 2000 - 'unfixed' use of quotemeta for splitting
                    multi-part forms. 'split' seems broken
                    according to the doc pages....

 1.05 03 Apr 2000 - Fixed breakage in 'param;' from 1.04 changes

 1.04 03 Apr 2000 - Added capability to set params via the param() method
                    like 'CGI.pm' plus general code cleanup

 1.03 02 Mar 2000 - 'mod_perl' compatibility added

 1.02 09 Jun 1999 - Initial public release.
