CGI::Minimal

An _extremely_ lightweight CGI processing package 
designed to provide form decoding and related
services with low overhead.


 1.06 10 April 2000 - 'unfixed' use of quotemeta on split parameter
                      for multi-part forms. It seems 'split' doesn't
                      work exactly as specified in the docs....

 1.05 03 April 2000 - Fixed breakage in 'param;' from 1.04 changes

 1.04 03 April 2000 - Added capability to set params via the param()
                      method like 'CGI.pm' plus general code cleanup
 
 1.03 02 March 2000 - 'mod_perl' compatibility added 

 1.02 09 June 1999  - Initial public release.
