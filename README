CGI::Minimal

An _extremely_ lightweight CGI processing package 
designed to provide form decoding and related
services with low overhead.

 1.09 19 Mar 2002   - Exposed CGI::Minimal::reset_globals class method to support
                      non-mod_perl persistent execution environments.

 1.08 26 Jul 2001   - Added 'raw' method for obtaining a dump of the raw input buffer data
                      without any parsing. Moved documentation into seperate POD file.

 1.07 01 Dec 2000   - Added capability of taking a GET style parameter string
                      via STDIN if running at the command line.

 1.06 10 April 2000 - 'unfixed' use of quotemeta on split parameter
                      for multi-part forms. It seems 'split' doesn't
                      work exactly as specified in the docs....

 1.05 03 April 2000 - Fixed breakage in 'param;' from 1.04 changes

 1.04 03 April 2000 - Added capability to set params via the param()
                      method like 'CGI.pm' plus general code cleanup
 
 1.03 02 March 2000 - 'mod_perl' compatibility added 

 1.02 09 June  1999 - Initial public release.
